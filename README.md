## To Do

- [X] Permutations of each lemma
- [X] Plot the results
- [ ] Subsume the hit results for each class. Subsume only the "vanilla" lemmas or also their translations?
- [ ] Don't replace result files, but rather create a new file for each run (using the date, keyword, command etc.)
- [ ] Make results.txt results.json
- [ ] Show classes of each lemma
- [ ] Better form of result visualization in results.txt
